# Hi there 👋
## 🚀 About me
🐺 I'm **Lupis**, an **IT specialist** in training based in Germany exploring the world of **Programming** and **Web Development**.

🧑🏻‍💻 I've always had a high interest in learning about computers and experimented with them since my early childhood, and I'm currently absolving an apprenticeship as a **System Integrator**.

🎤 Outside of working with computers, I also enjoy **singing**, having been featured in [**multiple songs**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2xUUaSCJS5CoNqH8UBDGwH) as the main vocalist and looking to expand my portfolio.

🎮 I also play a lot of **Video Games**, having favorites in various genres such as **Racing**, **Simulation**, **Rhythm** and **Action**.
